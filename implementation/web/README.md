# Web Client

Two folders should be contained in here:

## dist

Contains the built html, javascript and css files.
They have been set up to be accessible without hosting them on a server.
> Note that for the Web Client to work properly in the browser, the Web Server needs to be hosted on localhost Port 8080.
This should not be an issue in most cases.

## VueJSProject

Contains the vue.js project with all the source files and dependencies.
